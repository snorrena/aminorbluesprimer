aminorbluesprimer is an Android app that teaches guitar improvisation in A minor blues

The objective of the Android App A Minor Blues Primer is to get you rocking some Blues guitar solos with a bare minimum of effort.

First we'll start with a basic lesson on Blues music theory, then we'll move forward to a step by step audio and video tutorial showing you a few awesome solos that will take you gently through a standard 12 bar Blues chord progression.

Once you are comfortable with the supplied solos, you may review tips and tricks on how to build your own custom riffs and set yourself free to explore your own creative voice in world of Blues guitar improvisation.

This home school method worked for me, and it will work for you too!
